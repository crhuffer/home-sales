Data Sources
============

I've been getting a TON of recommendations of where to look for data.  What I actually need help with is not more links to invest time in, but people who are
passionate about reading the content at those links and reporting back what the opportunity is.  If you conduct such an investgation and would like to
contribute a link here, please send me a pull request.  Thanks!
